## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A deep, trustworthy blue (#34495E) to convey professionalism and intelligence. The color should have good contrast against both light and dark text.
- Background color: A light gray (#ECF0F1) to ensure readability and a clean, modern look. It echoes the primary blue in hue, but is extremely desaturated and bright.
- Accent color: A warm, approachable orange (#E67E22) used for CTAs and highlights to draw attention without feeling overly aggressive. It provides good visual contrast and ties in well with a blue color scheme, as it is an analogous color.
- A clean, professional font to balance approachability with readability. One font choice should be selected, to establish consistency of style.
- A grid-based layout to present content in an organized manner.
- Subtle, professional animations to subtly reveal content and make the UI more attractive. Animations should not distract or disrupt readability.
